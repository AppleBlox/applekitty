      title: "\"AppleBlox Not Opened\""
      description: |
        This is caused by macOS Gatekeeper placing the app in quarantine because it isn't signed. Here's how to fix it:
        1. Press **⌘ + Space**, type "Terminal", and press **Enter**
        2. Copy and paste this command: `curl https://appleblox.com/helper | bash`
        3. Press **Enter**

        AppleBlox should launch automatically after completing these steps.

      title: Why is my game lagging when using AppleBlox?
      description: |
        There are two main reasons why you might experience lag:

        1. **Hardware Limitations**: If your computer is old, you may experience lag. FastFlags are development features used by Roblox engineers - they're not magical FPS boosters. If you're unsure about what a specific flag does, feel free to ask in the general channel and someone may answer you.

        2. **AppleBlox Issue**: If you have a capable computer but still experience lag, please report the bug in <#1289925237420331072>.

      title: Why do I see a newer version available when I already have the latest version?
      description: |
        The newer versions you're seeing are **development builds**, which are typically less stable than our official releases. While they include the latest features, they may contain bugs.

        > If you want to try a development build, you can download it from https://appleblox.com/download/dev

      title: Will there be a Windows version?
      description: |
        **Yes, we plan to release a Windows version!** However, this requires us to:
        1. Switch from NeutralinoJS to Tauri for better cross-platform support
        2. Rewrite about 80% of our codebase

        Due to these requirements, the Windows version won't be available until after the 1.0 release.
