      title: "I Can't Open the App - It Shows an Error!"
      description: |
        This usually happens because we haven't signed and notarized the app (which costs $99/year). Below are solutions for common error messages.

      title: "\"AppleBlox Not Opened\""
      description: |
        This is caused by macOS Gatekeeper placing the app in quarantine because it isn't signed. To fix this:
        
        1. Press **⌘ + Space**, type "Terminal", and press **Enter**
        2. Copy and paste this command: `curl https://appleblox.com/helper | bash`
        3. Press **Enter**

        AppleBlox should launch automatically after completing these steps.

      title: "Why Is My Game Lagging When Using AppleBlox?"
      description: |
        There are two main reasons why you might experience lag:

        1. **Hardware Limitations**: If your computer is older, you may experience lag. FastFlags are development features used by Roblox engineers - they're not magical FPS boosters. If you're unsure about what a specific flag does, feel free to ask in the general channel.

        2. **AppleBlox Issue**: If you have a capable computer but still experience lag, please report the bug in <#1289925237420331072>.

      title: "Why Do I See a Newer Version Available When I Already Have the Latest?"
      description: |
        The newer versions you're seeing are **development builds**, which are typically less stable than our official releases. While they include the latest features, they may contain bugs.

        > If you want to try a development build, you can download it from [our dev channel](https://appleblox.com/download/dev)

      title: "Will There Be a Windows Version?"
      description: |
        **Yes, we plan to release a Windows version!** However, this requires us to:
        
        1. Switch from [NeutralinoJS](https://neutralino.js.org) to [Tauri](https://tauri.app) for better cross-platform support
        2. Rewrite about 80% of our codebase

        Due to these requirements, the Windows version won't be available until after the 1.0 release.
